# l4-build-data-module-using-arrow-functions
Using ES6 arrow functions, import/export between modules and React library - taken from CodeSandbox
Imports from React library includes App.js, React, and react-dom

Practice exercise for arrow functions and the intersectionality of modules while using React
The exercise was forked within codesandbox followed by my manipulation of the dom as commented within the code

You can fork and clone this if you want to adapt anything further and feel free!
